Accuracy,Evaluate the accuracy of the [candidate answer] using the following criteria: \n 1= The [candidate answer] is completely unrelated to the [correct answer]. \n 2= The [candidate answer] has minor relevance but does not align with the [correct answer]. \n 3= The [candidate answer] has moderate relevance to the [correct answer] but contains inaccuracies.\n 4= The [candidate answer] aligns with the [correct answer] but has minor errors or omissions.\n 5= The [candidate answer] is completely accurate and aligns perfectly with the [correct answer].
Contextual_Hallucination_1,"Evaluate the model answer and understand if the answer contains data or facts that are not in the ground_truth or context. If the model answer contains any information that is not mentioned in the context or ground truth answer, then the score should be greater than 3.: \n Score 1= All the information and facts that the answer provided are explicitly mentioned in either the ground_truth answer or the context. There cannot be any data that is well-known but is not in mentioned in the ground truth nor context. \n Score 2= The answer includes some information that is not explicitly mentioned in the ground truth nor in the ground context. The answer includes information that is generally known but not explicitly mentioned in the ground truth or context. \n Score 3= The answer includes some data or facts that are not in the ground truth, nor the ground context, and cannot be inferred from the ground_truth or ground context. The data does not add significant additional information compared to the ground_truth answer of context. \n Score 4: The answer includes misleading data, and it is not related to the ground truth or context and cannot be inferred from the ground_truth or ground context. \n Score 5: The answer includes data that is not related to ground truth or context."
Succinctness,"How effectively is the model creating answers that are succinct yet thorough? 1: The model's answers are either excessively lengthy and off-topic or too short and lack detail. 2: The model sometimes offers answers that are either short or thorough, but seldom both. 3: The model regularly creates answers that are succinct and thorough, though some irregularities are visible. 4: The model often generates answers that are both succinct and thorough, with few exceptions. 5: The model steadily delivers answers that are both succinct and thorough, upholding an ideal equilibrium between conciseness and detail."
Contextual_Hallucination," Evaluate the [candidate answer] up to which point contain information upported by the [context] or [ground truth]:
        Score 1: The [candidate answer] responds to the [question] and all the facts in the [candidate answer] are explicitly mentioned in the [context] or the [correct answer].  
        Score 2: The [candidate answer] responds to the [question], the [candidate answer] constains the substance of information but some Minor information not explicitly mentioned in the [context] nor in the [correct answer]. 
        Score 3: The [candidate answer] responds to the [question], the [candidate answer] is NOT related to the [context] or the [correct answer]. 
        Score 4: The [candidate answer] does not answer the [question], the [candidate answer] is not related to the [correct answer] or [contenxt], but it is coherent and provides facts. 
        Score 5: The [candidate answer] does not answer the [question], the [candidate answer] is incoherent and it is nor related to any of the topics mentioned in the context or correct answer.
